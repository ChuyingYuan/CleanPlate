## What is the problem

Food waste has become an increasing concern in Victoria in recent years. A study conducted by Sustainability Victoria recorded over 2.4 million tonnes of food waste being thrown out from Victoria in 2020, which contributes to greenhouse gases emission (Sustainability Victoria, 2024). In terms of Melbourne, it recorded over 900,000 tonnes of edible food waste, and 2.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gases are generated from food waste (Foodprint Melbourne, 2018). The largest contributor of food waste is households, which are responsible for around 30% of the total â€Œ(DCCEEW, 2024). Despite there being existing resources targeted to prevent food waste, those resources are mostly text-based and lack engagement. Therefore, the existing resources could not effectively change their behaviours.

_**How can we create an engaging and educational platform that will change their behaviour towards food waste?**_

## Who are we targeting at?

Residential households - Young couples aged 45 or below with young children

## Solution

CleanPlate

- An web application designed to help users manage their food inventory, track food waste, and make better food choices.

## Features

- **Educative Dashboard**:
  <br>
  Provides interactive dashboard that educates households on food waste. It will display a map of Melbourne showing food waste statistics and impacts, and offer strategies for reducing household food waste. The goal is to raise awareness and encourage sustainable practices.

- **Food Expiry Tracker**:
  <br>
  Help users manage expiry dates of their food. Users can record their food products through barcode, receipts and an image of produce (fruits/ vegetables). It aims to reduce food waste through better meal planning and timely action.

- **Notifcation**:
  <br>
  Provides a calender view about the number of items expiring and detailed lists of expiring items on specific dates, helping users, especially busy parents, to have an overview of expiring items and consume items before they spoil.
